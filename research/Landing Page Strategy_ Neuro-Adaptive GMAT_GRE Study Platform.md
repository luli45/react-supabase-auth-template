## 1. Page Architecture & Navigation

The navigation is designed to be persistent and low-friction, ensuring that the primary call to action is always accessible without overwhelming the user.

| Component | Specification | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Position** | Fixed/Sticky Header | Remains visible on scroll to reduce cognitive search load. |
| **Primary CTA** | "Request Demo" | High-contrast button (Soft Amber) in the top right. |
| **Secondary Link** | "Sign In" | Subtle text link for existing users. |
| **Menu Links** | Platform, Solutions, Resources, Pricing | Minimalist set to avoid "Choice Paralysis." |

## 2. Hero Section: The "Unmasking" Hook

The Hero section uses a two-column split (60/40) to balance persuasive copy with a calming visual representation of the app.

### 2.1 Copy Structure
*   **Pre-headline Badge:** `[Icon] Trusted by 5,000+ Neurodivergent Professionals`
*   **Headline (H1):** **Eliminate GMAT/GRE Task Paralysis and Reclaim Your Focus.**
*   **Subheadline:** Stop fighting your brain. Our AI-powered platform transforms dense study materials into neuro-adaptive podcasts and high-signal summaries designed for ADHD and Autistic learners.
*   **Dual CTA Strategy:**
    *   **Primary:** `Schedule a Demo` (Soft Amber Button)
    *   **Secondary:** `See How It Works` (Ghost Button with Play Icon)
*   **Micro-copy:** *Free access for students • No credit card required • Designed for neurodiversity*

### 2.2 Visual Component
A high-fidelity mockup of the **"Audio Study Mode"** interface, showing a clean, sensory-friendly player with variable speed controls and a synchronized transcript.

## 3. The "Problem-Solution" Bridge (Feature Sections)

This section directly addresses the frustrations identified in the Alex Chen avatar research.

### 3.1 Feature 1: The "Wall of Awful" Breaker
*   **Headline:** **Turn Dense Textbooks into On-the-Go Podcasts.**
*   **Copy:** Don't let a 500-page manual trigger a shutdown. Our AI scrapes the most relevant content from across the web and Reddit, converting it into high-quality audio you can listen to while walking, driving, or doing chores.
*   **Visual:** An illustration of a user wearing noise-canceling headphones, transitioning from a cluttered desk to a calm outdoor walk.

### 3.2 Feature 2: High-Signal Scrapping
*   **Headline:** **Filter the Noise. Focus on the Signal.**
*   **Copy:** We scrape the latest insights from Reddit and top prep sites to see what’s *actually* on the exam right now. No fluff, no outdated chapters—just the content that matters for your specific score goals.
*   **Visual:** A "Before vs. After" comparison showing a cluttered search result page vs. a clean, summarized dashboard in the app.

## 4. Social Proof & Trust Indicators

To build credibility with a skeptical "Problem Aware" audience, we use peer-based social proof.

*   **Logo Bar:** Grayscale logos of top graduate schools (Harvard, Stanford, INSEAD) where our users have been accepted.
*   **Testimonial (The "Alex" Archetype):**
    > "I spent three years stuck in task paralysis. Every other prep course felt like it was written in a language I didn't speak. This platform finally 'clicked' because it let me study without sitting still for four hours." — *Jordan M., Data Analyst & MBA Candidate*
