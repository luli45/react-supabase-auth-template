## 1. Executive Summary

This report synthesizes qualitative data scraped from major Reddit communities, including r/GMAT, r/GRE, and r/ADHD. The findings reveal a high prevalence of **burnout, anxiety, and executive dysfunction** among test-takers. Neurodivergent individuals, in particular, face systemic barriers, including difficult accommodation processes and sensory-unfriendly testing environments. There is a significant trend of students switching from the GMAT to the GRE to escape "mental baggage" and find a more "rule-based" testing experience.

## 2. The Emotional Journey: From Anxiety to Burnout

Reddit users frequently describe their GMAT/GRE journey as an emotional rollercoaster. Career anxiety often serves as the initial trigger, but the prolonged nature of preparation frequently leads to a state of chronic burnout.

### 2.1 Dominant Sentiments
The following table categorizes the most common emotional states reported by users:

| Emotion | Description | Common Triggers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Burnout** | Mental exhaustion and "checking out" from prep. | Studying for 12+ months; repeated score plateaus. |
| **Imposter Syndrome** | Feeling "less than average intelligence" despite professional success. | Struggling with "basic" quant or verbal logic. |
| **Task Paralysis** | Inability to start or maintain a study session. | Overwhelming volume of material; fear of failure. |
| **Shame** | Deep embarrassment over scores or study habits. | Comparing self to peers on LinkedIn or Reddit. |

> "GMAT burnout is a real thing. No matter how much I wanted to prepare more I just checked out mentally. I developed a deep seated fear of the GMAT." [1]

## 3. Neurodivergent Challenges & Barriers

For students with ADHD, Autism, or other neurodivergent traits, the challenges of standardized testing are amplified by executive dysfunction and sensory sensitivities.

### 3.1 Executive Dysfunction and the "Wall of Awful"
Users report significant difficulty with the "Standardized Testing Industrial Complex." The "Wall of Awful"—an emotional barrier to starting tasks—is a frequent topic in r/ADHD and r/GRE. Traditional study methods, such as reading 500-page manuals, often trigger task paralysis.

### 3.2 The Accommodation Struggle
A major point of frustration is the process of obtaining accommodations from ETS (GRE) and GMAC (GMAT). Users describe the requirements as "outrageous," often involving costly and time-consuming additional testing, such as full IQ batteries, even when a prior diagnosis exists.

> "I gave ETS a copy from adhd diagnosis report... They said it wasn't enough evidence for accomodations. Not to my surprise, I got a horrible score on the exam!" [2]

## 4. The "Switch" Strategy: GMAT to GRE

A significant number of users discuss switching from the GMAT to the GRE. This is often motivated by a desire for a "clean slate" and a perception that the GRE is more compatible with certain cognitive styles.

*   **Perceived Simplicity:** The GRE is often viewed as more "rule-based" and less reliant on the complex, multi-layered logic of the GMAT's Data Insights (DI) section. [1]
*   **Quant Comfort:** Many users find GRE Quant more "natural" and less prone to the "traps" found in GMAT Quant.
*   **Mental Baggage:** Switching tests allows users to leave behind the negative associations and "baggage" accumulated during failed GMAT attempts. [1]

## 5. Emerging Needs: Audio and Alternative Learning

There is a clear demand for non-traditional study materials. Users in r/GRE and r/GMAT frequently ask for podcasts or audiobooks to utilize "dead time" during commutes or chores. This format is particularly appealing to those with ADHD who struggle to sit still for long periods of visual study.
